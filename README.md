## Workshop 

The workshop consists of four parts: (i) an introduction to the workshop , (ii) panel presentations including yours, (iii) a working group session with two rounds during which the participants discuss the different questions, and (iv) a closing session during which next steps, based on the working groups output, are put forward. 


## Two questions

* How can multilayer networks help to build a quantitative model for integrating resilience and sustainability?

* Which states should an archipielago cross to connect global resilience to local sustainability?
