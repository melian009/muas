## Workshop 
The workshop:
The workshop is scheduled for 26 June, 09:00 - 17:00. It consists of four parts: (i) an introduction to the workshop , (ii) panel presentations including yours, (iii) a working group session with two rounds during which the participants discuss the different questions, and (iv) a closing session during which next steps, based on the working groups output, are put forward. 
Your talk will be the first talk in the program scheduled for about 9:15, if this is alright with you.

We are very happy that you will give a talk of between 15 - 30 minutes TBC next week, with time for Q&A. Please may we ask you if you could send us two questions that you believe would be interesting to discuss during the working group sessions of the workshop. This is to make sure that the outcome is of interest to you and to all participants.
